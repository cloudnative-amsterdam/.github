## Hi there 👋!

We are the Dutch Cloud Native + AI Community, you can find us on [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dutchcloudnative/?viewAsMember=true)) and [meetup.com]([url](https://www.meetup.com/Dutch-cloud-native)).

We run a successful meetup and the yearly conference [Cloud Native Community Days Amsterdam]([url](https://cloudnative.amsterdam)), join us!

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Core Commitments

### Principles
We are a community-oriented organization, meaning we thrive, support, and side with the local cloud native/AI/sustainability community of people, organizations, practitioners and users to promote the principles of equal and responsible access to technology.
We are non-profit, meaning we will re-invest most of the proceedings of the conference and events we organise, provided all costs are covered and the volunteers are compensated to some extent for their efforts.
We advocate for responsible use of technology (i.e. AI) and to limit our impact on the environment and the city that hosts us; we aim to be a net-zero event and community.
We radically welcome everyone in the community, as organiser, volunteer or attendee; we strive to create an open, inclusive community that will create safe spaces for growing the discourse around cloud native computing and AI.

### Guidelines

We keep the ticket price as low as possible, to include more people and have a bigger impact.  We promote diversity thru diversity tickets (buy 1 + pay 1 for a diverse/minority), corporate sponsorship, scholarships and more options
We will have livestream during the event, with professional recording and transcription
We are primarily interested in end-users, real-world stories rather than vendor talks/pitches, and we favor local speakers rather than international ones (to both foster local connections and limit environmental impact). 
Transparency in reporting financial results and diversity number is paramount and will be shared with the community in a timely manner.
